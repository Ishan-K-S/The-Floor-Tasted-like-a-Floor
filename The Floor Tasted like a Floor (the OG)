The floor tasted like a floor. And he would know, his job was exclusively to taste floors in various countries and elevations. Not very crunchy to most, but his 'taster', who is definately paid and not an unpaid intern, was able to easily shred the pieces, usually of wood, and describe the taste vividly to him. 

This floor however, had been described to him as older and way more unstable than most. The definately paid individual looked extremely worried, and was barely surprised when the broken and old floor collapsed beneath them. 

However, he was frightened by the sudden descent, and barely had time to react before his inevitable demise.
